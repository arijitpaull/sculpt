    fullDescription:
      "Dakkapel Offerte is a utility app developed for Dakkapel Fabriek, a Dutch company specializing in roof renovations. The app leverages phone sensors to calculate the roof’s angle in real-time and lets users send a full renovation request—complete with project details, address, angle data (manual, normal, or AR mode), and attic images—to the company via email. It’s designed to streamline appointment booking and eliminate the need for initial site visits.",
    image: "/images/dakkapel-thumbnail.png",
    challenge:
      "Capturing accurate roof angles using phone sensors proved to be a complex challenge. We had to ensure the angle readings remained stable and unaffected by unintended phone movements or shaking. Creating a real-time dynamic protractor and ensuring accurate calibration required extensive experimentation with various Flutter sensor packages.",
    solution:
      "We built a lightweight interface that offered three measurement modes: sensor-based, AR-assisted, and manual. A visual protractor displayed an animated arrow that reacted to device tilt in real time. We implemented filtering techniques and custom calibration logic to lock angles accurately. Once the data was captured, all project details—including images and user info—were sent to the company via SMTP, automating the renovation inquiry process.",
    results:
      "The app helped Dakkapel Fabriek drastically reduce lead friction. Customers were now able to send accurate, visual, and structured requests without the need for an in-person assessment. The company's internal workflow benefited from faster data collection, and the app became an effective bridge between offline renovation work and online lead generation.",

The system supports image uploads for completed tasks and ensures secure data handling using robust backend architecture.",
    image: "/images/funutrition-thumbnail.png",
    challenge:
      "We had to design an interface that appealed to children while integrating complex backend functionality for multiple user roles (children, parents, admins). Managing secure authentication, role-based permissions, and real-time media uploads—while keeping the experience smooth—posed significant architectural challenges. Calibrating Supabase triggers and policies for this multi-flow environment required detailed attention.",
    solution:
      "We created a vibrant, structured app interface tailored to young audiences while ensuring admins and parents had complete control and visibility. The backend was powered by Supabase and Hive, supporting features like streak tracking, media uploads, and real-time monitoring. We integrated over 200 pre-designed AI-generated lessons and 40+ gamified challenges. Admins could view logs, send personalized plans, and manage submissions from a unified backend interface.",

      "The app received positive feedback from both users and the client. Parents loved the clarity and oversight it provided, while children enjoyed the interactive challenges. The admin dashboard streamlined lesson management and communication. The app was praised for its structure, ease of use, and visual appeal. The client plans to expand the offering with family plans and gamified learning modules.",
